The project was made as part of my Android development course I have taken in HIT.
In the project i have used miltiple technologies as MVVM, Retrofit , GeoCoder, Hilt & Dagger for dependency injection, WorkManager to gain the ability to schedule a notification every 24hours to see tomorrow's forecast and plan the day accordingly.
The user has the abilitiy to see the weather based on his current location, the user needs first to give permissions for the location and notifications if he wants to see tomorrow's weather forecast based on the time he chose.
We can search for specific countries or cities around the world and to see more info about the weather as well as weekly weather and hourly weather for the current day as well as the ability to see the city or the country the user has chose on the map.
There is a history tab and also a favorite tab in which the user can see all the cities or countries he searched for, and also to add a specific city to favorites.
